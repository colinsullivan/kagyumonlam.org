<li class="first">
  <strong>Technical Writer / Information Systems Analyst</strong>. In my first role at Google, I managed the documentation for all internal Human Resources applications, assisted with application development, and played a significant role in other company-wide HR communications. This role lasted from July 2007 through September of 2010 and included:
<ul>
  <li>
    Developing and maintaining documentation for all HR systems (<u><a href="http://www.corp.google.com/help/ats/">ATS</a></u>, <u><a href="http://www.corp.google.com/help/compass/">Compass</a></u>, <u><a href="https://www.corp.google.com/info/managers/gcomp-help/">gComp</a></u>, <u><a href="http://www.corp.google.com/help/googlehr/">GHR</a></u>, HR Reporting [now deprecated], <u><a href="http://www.corp.google.com/help/lgm/">LGM</a></u>, Perf [now deprecated]). 
  </li>
  <li>
    Led the development effort for a website to share PeopleOps information. Developed the idea for the project, vetted it with Directors, recruited an eight-person 20% team, and actively contributed to design, coding, implementation, review, and maintenance. The current site living at <a href="http://go/peopleops">go/peopleops</a> has changed somewhat since I left the project, but the essential design is the same. 
  </li>
  <li>
    Leading a company-wide project to make HR information more accessible and reduce ticket volume to HR help queues. The only outcome of this project still visible is the <a href="https://www.corp.google.com/peopleops/pages/hr3-faq.html">HR Help FAQ</a>. We built this FAQ directly from the most frequent topics in the HR-Help GUTS queue. The FAQ significantly reduced ticket volume on these common issues, and also decreased the amount of time required for HR staff to respond to common questions.
  </li>
  <li>
    Managing a technical writing contractor. 
  </li>
  <li>
    Holding at least two fixits yearly to continuously improve HR documentation in an Agile way. I built the fixit structure so anyone can run it. 
  </li>
  <li>
    Leading a team to analyze and consolidate Moma resources relating to internal transfer. Reduced the number of &quot;official&quot; transfer sites from 12 to 4.
  </li>
  <li>
    Developing contextual help and interface text within the GHR, Perf, and gComp applications. 
  </li>
  <li>
    Mentoring Googlers interested in technical writing and web design. 
  </li>
  <li>
    Leading a team to redesign the <a href="http://compass.corp.google.com/jobCodes?jobFamily=HR_HRTO">PTO career ladder</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Assembling and leading a 20% team to develop the People Operations website (now deprecated). 
  </li>
  <li>
    Developing web-based dashboards for presenting People Analytics data to the OC. 
  </li>
  <li>
    Attending the highly selective &quot;People Operations Basecamp&quot; leadership in HR training, which made me realize that I am poorly suited for an HR career.
  </li>
  <li>
    Designed the <a href="certificate.html">&quot;Peer Bonus&quot; template</a> that every Googler sees when they receive a Peer Bonus.

<h3>Commitment to Google Culture</h3>

</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Worked with facilities and executive stakeholders to build out three meditation spaces: two in Mountain View and one in San Francisco. (Here's <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/google.com/present/view?id=dfcqtrtr_177k4d5jvck">the proposal</a> I wrote with ario.)
  </li>
  <li>
    Negotiated a discount for Google, and Googlers, on high-quality meditation mats and cushions. 
  </li>
  <li>
    Wrote a <a href="http://docs.google.com/a/google.com/View?id=dcqw4r5m_162t9gc6hhm">proposal</a> to bring the <a href="http://steamtreehouse.com/Home.html">Steampunk Treehouse</a> to Crittenden. The proposal was very popular around Google, and even made it to the Founders. Unfortunately, Mountain View city codes foiled the project.
  </li>
  <li>
    Hosted Burning Man-oriented movie nights and other activities
  </li>
